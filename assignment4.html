            <br />Here is all the documentation for assignment 3!
            <br />I used 93 LEDs in total
            <br />18W * (93/300) = 5.58W
            <br />I = 5.58W / 12V = 0.465A
            <br />So, the maximum current that goes through the transistor should be 0.465A, which is smaller than 0.6A
            <br />I also added an ammeter to see how the current changes with the lighting.
            <br />
            <br />For the resistor that connects with the transistor:
            <br />The ideal current that flows through the microcontroller is 0.02A,
            <br />To protect it, 12V / 0.02A = 600&#8486;, which means 600&#8486;can protect the circuit
            <br />in any case with or without the voltage drop.
            <br />Here I use 10k just to be safe.
            <br />
            <br />For the resistor with the photoresistor:
            <br />5V / 0.02A = 250&#8486;
            <br />So any resistors larger than 250&#8486; can be used. Here I use 10k to be safe.

            <br />Schematic - there are three main parts -- a photoresistor with a 10k resisitor
            <br /> a LED strip, and a transistor with a 10k resistor
